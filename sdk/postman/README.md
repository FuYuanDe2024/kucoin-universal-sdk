# Postman API Collection Documentation

Welcome to the **Postman API Collection** for the KuCoin Universal SDK. This collection is designed to provide a quick and interactive way to explore and test the KuCoin APIs directly within Postman.

For an overview of the KuCoin Universal SDK and implementations in other languages, refer to the [README](https://github.com/kucoin/kucoin-universal-sdk).

## üì¶ Installation

**Note:** The API collection is actively maintained and updated in line with KuCoin's API specifications. Feedback and contributions to improve the collection are highly encouraged.

1. Visit the official Postman collection shared link: [KuCoin API Collection on Postman](https://www.postman.com/kucoin-api/kucoin-api/overview).
2. Log in to your Postman account on the web (or create one if you don't have an account).
3. Click **Run in Postman** or **Fork Collection** to add the collection directly to your Postman workspace.
4. Once added, navigate to your workspace, where the collection will be available for immediate use.
5. If you are using the Postman desktop app, the collection will automatically sync with your desktop workspace once added to your account.
6. Configure the environment variables according to your API credentials and begin testing KuCoin's APIs.

## Set Up Environment Variables

To use the collection effectively, follow these steps:

#### Steps to Configure

1. In Postman, select the preconfigured environment named **`KuCoin API Production`** from the **Environment** dropdown.
2. Fill in the following variables based on your usage needs:
   - **Mandatory Variables** (required only for private API endpoints):
     - `API_KEY`: Your KuCoin API key.
     - `API_SECRET`: Your KuCoin API secret.
     - `API_PASSPHRASE`: Your KuCoin API passphrase.
   - **Optional Variables** (only required for broker-related APIs):
     - `BROKER_NAME`: Name of the broker account.
     - `BROKER_PARTNER`: Partner information associated with the broker account.
     - `BROKER_KEY`: Key associated with the broker account for authentication.
3. For public API endpoints (e.g., market data), the mandatory variables are not required and can be left blank.
4. Save the environment to ensure all variables are correctly applied.
5. Return to the Postman main interface and select **`KuCoin API Production`** from the **Environment** dropdown to activate the configuration.
6. Once configured, you're ready to use the Postman collection.
